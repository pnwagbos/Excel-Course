## HOW IT WORKS:

```
Your Computer (C:\tmp)
         ↓
    GitHub (your repository)
         ↓
  GitHub Pages (hosting)
         ↓
   Student's Browser
   (Just click link!)
```

---

## FILES TO UPLOAD:

From `C:\tmp`, upload these:

```
Root Level:
  ✓ github-pages-index.html (rename to index.html)
  ✓ package.json
  ✓ vite.config.ts
  ✓ tsconfig.json
  ✓ index.html (original)
  ✓ All documentation files

Folders:
  ✓ src/ (all files)
```

**IMPORTANT:** GitHub Pages looks for `index.html` in the root!

Use `github-pages-index.html` - it's the standalone version!

---

## SPECIAL FILE: github-pages-index.html

I created a special standalone HTML file that:
- ✅ Doesn't need any build process
- ✅ Works directly in GitHub Pages
- ✅ Has all styling included
- ✅ Has all interactive features
- ✅ Shows all 5 modules
- ✅ Shows all 20 lessons
- ✅ Has the quiz
- ✅ Works immediately

Rename it to `index.html` when you upload!
